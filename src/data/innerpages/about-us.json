After almost two decades of hand-crafting websites and web applications for corporate America, this diagnosis would prove to be a watershed moment in my life. It would push me to face challenges harder than anything else I had ever encountered. It would also cause me to find greater satisfaction and enjoyment in my own life than I could have ever dreamed of."

It didn't take much convincing to get these amazing people on board with this project, and before we knew it we had a real motley crew."
