I've wanted to start my own business for a _very_ long time. After decades building a truly impressive skillset in IT and Software Development, I've begun branching out on my own.

Until very recently I've lived my life suffering from the delusion that there's just really not enough money to go around. I believed that in order for me to make any amount of money in life I'd have to work for someone else. I believed that owning and operating a business required some sort of supernatural IQ, or a work ethic that was just unreachable by the likes of me.

Now, after plying my craft at half a dozen companies and watching how money is actually made in the market, I know I can do this for myself.
