                        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
                        And sorry I could not travel both<br />
                        And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
                        And looked down one as far as I could<br />
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
                        <br />
                        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
                        And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
                        Though as for that the passing there<br />
                        Had worn them really about the same,<br />
                        <br />
                        And both that morning equally lay<br />
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
                        <br />
                        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br />
                        I took the one less traveled by,<br />
                        And that has made all the difference.<br />
